`LEAF ADAPTATION`

`

Storage/perennation by bulbs (Narcissus and Lilium):


Water storage (Sedum) – thick, waxy, cuticle cells store water in the leaf.

Sedum spectabile “Autumn Joy”.

Leaf Adaptations Limiting Water Loss: Common in plants from warm or windy climate,
RHS – Thick waxy cuticle to reduce evaporation, e.g., Echeveria elegans;


 RHS – Reduced leaf surface area, conifer needles; 
Pinus sylvestris
RHS – Leaves covered in hairs to keep humidity close to the area of the stomata;
  Salvia argentea

Having fewer stomata;
Having deep or extensive root systems;
Having light, silver/grey foliage to reflect heat; 
Sunken stomata;Leaves that roll with the stomata on  the inside, some grasses, e.g., Festuca glauca;
Structural adaptations, e.g., Spartium junceum (Spanish broom) has very small leaves but the stem is dark green and photosynthesises;
Spines, e.g., Opuntia polyacantha.




Protection by leaf spine (Berberis):


Climbing by tendrils (Lathyrus odoratus):



Twisting petioles (Clematis):
