## BEDROCK
### Definition
  Bedrock often gives a soil a distinct colour (some red soils in Somerset are derived from the under-lying red sandstone). Chalk in the  soil on the downs can look white when dry. In geology, bedrock is the lithified rock that lies under a loose softer material called regolith at the surface of the Earth or other terrestrial planets. The broken and weathered regolith includes soil and subsoil
