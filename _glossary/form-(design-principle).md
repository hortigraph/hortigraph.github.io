`FORM (DESIGN PRINCIPLE)`

`

The overall form of the garden will help with the overall harmony and balance of a garden.
The easiest way to think of what ‘form’ might mean in a garden is to think of what a ‘formless’ garden might look like.
A garden that gathered in as many different plants as possible might be ‘formless’ unless the plants were carefully arranged.
Serpentine form, curving form, rigid form.
