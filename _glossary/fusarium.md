`FUSARIUM`

`

Fusarium patch (snow mould):
This disease is common and troublesome in northern areas where prolonged periods of wet, cool weather occur from autumn to middle or late spring and early summer.  Fusarium patch disease in these areas often occurs in the absence of snow and is favoured by cool or cold wet weather when grass growth is retarded;
Follow a recommended fertilizer program for your area and the grass or grasses being grown.  Snow mould damage can be reduced by using balanced fertilization.  Maintain high potassium and phosphorus soil test values.  Avoid fertilization with nitrogen within about 6 weeks of a killing frost.
