`STEM CORTEX`

Cortex – 3 layers of differing tissues:
Outer cells have thickened walls providing strengthening of the stem – can contain chloroplast.
Mid-cells are large with large air spaces – they store starch and allow gaseous exchange.
Inner cells – the endodermis single layer of tightly packed cells which store starch and allow solutions to pass from the cortex to the vascular bundle.
