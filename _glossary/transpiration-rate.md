`TRANSPIRATION RATE`

`

"the factors that affect the rate of transpiration.

Relative Humidity:
The drier the relative humidity outside the leaf the greater the potential gradient, so the quicker the water will move out of the leaf.

Temperature:
Temperature rise will increase the rate of evaporation of the water within the leaf so increasing the rate of transpiration.

Wind Speed:
The greater the wind speed over the leaf, the quicker the water is taken away from the stomata, reducing the relative humidity close to the leaf, so increasing the rate of transpiration.
