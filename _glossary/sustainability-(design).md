`SUSTAINABILITY-(DESIGN)`

Describe how the environmental sustainability of landscaping materials may affect choices made during the planning and design stage.

Check the origin of materials â€“ do not use Indian imported granite sets or Westmorland lime stone pavement, or recycled;
Do not use peat as a soil improver;
Local stone from a sustainable source has cheaper transport cost;
Use local sourced wood (hazel, willow) from worked/coppiced woods for seats, wattle hurdles, etc.;
Use solar powered features, such as water fountains or path lighting.  Specify the use of recycled materials such as rock and bricks (features such as stone seats and statues);
Local might not mean sustainable.
