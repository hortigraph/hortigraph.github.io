## AQUATIC PLANT
### Definition
Decide whether you would like your plants to be native water plants or exotics. Freshwater Habitats Trust (was Pond Conservation) has produced a leaflet ‘Planting-up Ponds’ with suggestions for native species that will attract wildlife
Consider not planting up a pond and allowing plants to colonise naturally. Most gardeners, however, are keen to get going with planting up from the start
Choose the right plants for the depth of water. There are waterlilies, for example suitable for all depths, from 10cm deep to 1.2m and deeper
Some water plants and marginals are vigorous, spreading via roots or by self-seeding such as in the case of sweet flag (Acorus calamus ‘Argenteostriatus’). This can be useful in larger water gardens, but if you have a small pond, consider the potential inhabitants carefully
It is good practice to quarantine purchases for a few weeks before introducing them. Many potentially invasive species, such as Crassula helmsii, are introduced into ponds unknowingly as contaminants on newly-acquired water plants
In recent years a growing problem has been posed by a number of introduced aquatic plants. These can be very invasive and can have seriously detrimental effects on gardens and the wider landscape. In early 2013 Defra announced a ban on sale of five of the worst invasive water plants in the UK
