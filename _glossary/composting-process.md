A good sized heap helps in generating heat and cooking the compost, minimum 1m³ – FILLED IN ONE GO.
Are these plastic bins large enough to get efficient composting. Perhaps best used as collecting bins for later amalgamation.


Establishment and Development:
Building a compost heap / bin.

Collect a good volume of composting material first, a good mixture;
Build heap or fill bin ideally in one go;
Layer different materials, alternately green and brown.
Chop big items such as cabbage leaves;
Soil to provide bacteria;
Moisten any dry material and firm  down 
Finish with a insulating layer and waterproof lid 
Heap will heat up – turn the heap when the temperature starts to fall so that the inner core becomes the outer layer;
Repeat turning;
When the hot phase has finished the material can be used (as long material) or leave to mature (cold phase).
