`RATE OF PHOTOSYTHESIS`

environmental factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis:
Temperature;
Light;
Intensity;
Quality/PAR = photosynthetically-active radiation, wave band of solar radiation from 400-700 nanometres that photosynthetic organs are able to use in photosynthesis;
Duration;
Carbon dioxide;
Water;
Mineral nutrients.

Factors limiting photosynthesis:
Three factors can limit the speed of photosynthesis:
light intensity
carbon dioxide concentration
temperature.
