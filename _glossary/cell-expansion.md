`CELL EXPANSION`

Seeds are dehydrated and the first stage of germination is the imbibition/ absorption of water causing the cells to rehydrate causing cell expansion.  Often seeds are soaked before being sown (seeds are seen to swell quickly).  Also the new cells in the growing tips expand “Zone of Elongation” – cell expansion by water uptake.
