`NUTRIENT SOURCE`

`

The benefits and limitations of nutrient sources:

Environmental:
Bulky organic;
Good recycling of organic material;
Runoff from heaps can pollute waterways;
Fertilises;
Issue of energy used in manufacture;
Some quick acting materials can leach and pollute waterways (algae bloom);
Salt residues can build up in soils or compost to toxic levels.
 
Health and Safety:
All weight of handling;
Bulky organic pathogen content? (hygiene);
Allergy to contents possible
Attracts dogs  cats & foxes to the plants
Bone meal unsterilized may carry CJD – all commercial types now sterilised
Imported organic anthrax in unsterilized blood and bone meal


Timing of application:
Bulky organic winter digging in;
Spring – use as mulches;
Fertilisers:
Base – use in preparation stage;
Top/liquid/foliar – apply to growing crop as required;
Lawns – spring and summer, high nitrogen up to August;
Spring cabbage – late March to give a boost to growth after the winter leaching of nutrients from the soil.

Variability of the material:
Bulky organics nutrient content very variable;
Organic fertilisers slightly variable;
Inorganic fertiliser stable content.
