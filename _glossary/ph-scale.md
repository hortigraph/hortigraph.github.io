he concept of pH was introduced by Danish chemist Soren Sorensen in 1909.  The exact meaning of p is unknown, often referred to as “Power of Hydrogen” or some say “Potential Hydrogen”.

The pH of a solution is a measurement of its acidity or alkalinity and is defined as “The negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration”.
