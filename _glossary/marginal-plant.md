`MARGINAL PLANT`

These plants are ornamental in flower and foliage and soften the harsh outlines of pools. They are also valuable for shading pool margins where algae may otherwise multiply in the warm, shallow water. For small pools, plant separately in 15cm (6in) containers and re-pot when overcrowded. Heights given indicate length of leaves or flowers above the water surface.`

Marginals are grown on the inside edge of the pond, or in a bog garden.  If bought in plastic pots or small baskets, replant into aquatic baskets.  When planting bare-rooted plants in summer, trim back the tops by half and trim the roots back to within 2.5cm (1in) of the crown
