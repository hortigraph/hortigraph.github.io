`NO DIG GARDENING`

`

Often as raised beds;
Apart from the normal soil disturbance of sowing planting or harvesting, the soil is left and not dug in the normal way.  Once created, bulky organic matter is shredded and applied to the surface as required in the normal way of the rotation.  It is naturally drawn down into the soil by the action of worms.  This allows for the soils’ fertility to build up as the soils’ bacteria are undisturbed and operate in the soil at their preferred level.  Weed seeds are not brought to the surface to germinate.
