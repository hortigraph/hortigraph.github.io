`HYDROPONICS`

“Growing plants in water culture”.
There are 2 common methods NFT (nutrient film technique) and substrate culture (rock wool);
Widely used in the commercial production of salad crops under glass.
Water Quality:
Good clean water supply required (tap);
This is filtered as it circulates and passed through an ultra violet light tube to control pathogens and algae growth.

Pest/Disease Control (water quality/pathogens):
As the whole system is very intensive in many ways (for maximum growth) everything is geared up – maximum solution/correct pH/high growing temperature/high light intensity.  If anything goes wrong it can quickly spread and the whole crop lost very quickly (a waterborne pathogen can be circulated through the whole crop in a matter of hours).  It is usual to use preventative rather than creative measures.
Automation of the system is possible.
