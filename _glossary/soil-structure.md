`SOIL STRUCTURE`

Soil structure is how the particles (sand, silt and clay) are built, glued, cemented, or aggregated together to ideally form a “crumb structure” (peds).

The glues of the soil are:
“Humus” and to a lesser extent bulky organic matter which in time becomes Humus;
Clay colloids;
Minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium;
Gums secreted by some plant roots;
Adhesion between particles is via electrostatic force (flocculation) or cementing substances.
