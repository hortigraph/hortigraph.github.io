`IRRIGATION`

Watering plants to ensure water supply at the roots`

Water-in plants after planting and when necessary to maintain growth and flowering.  Too much = weeds & little flowers.  Some plants like it drier – Marigolds, Gazania, Geranium.  Some plants like it wetter – Begonia, Fuchsias.

Drought stress is common with newly planted trees and shrubs.  Even in a cool, wet summer, the rain rarely replenishes soil moisture stores fully.  The soil may be dry around the roots even when the surface appears moist;

Dry, windy conditions are especially likely to lead to water shortages.  With experience, it is possible to detect the dull, lifeless foliage indicative of drought stress but by then the tree has already been damaged.  Ideally anticipate water loss, and irrigate to prevent damage.
