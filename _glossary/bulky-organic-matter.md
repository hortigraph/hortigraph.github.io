## BULKY ORGANIC MATTER

### Description
"BOM has a great physical effect on the soil structure:
Long manure/young compost opens up heavy soils;
Short manure/well-rotted compost sticks light soils together.

All BOM break down and become humus – the major soil glue that glues soil partials together to form soil structure.

Both BOM and especially humus hold water in the soil helping in soil structure creation and water availability.

Soil structure influences the soil’s workability.

Both BOM and especially humus make the soil darker so improving the rate the soil will warm up.  Good for early crops.  Warmer soils will hold heat longer at night so reducing the risk of ground frost.
