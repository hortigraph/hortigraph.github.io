`ORGANIC NUTRIENT`

`

Material that once was living;
Organic must contain Carbon;
Often requiring bacterial activity to release the nutrient to the plant (can be considered slow acting);
Bulky â€“ farmyard manures/compost:
A large volume of organic matter with a small amount of nutrients;
Applied in large volumes so the low nutrient value becomes a useful amount;
Has a high effect on the soil as an organic matter (building up soil structure/ becoming humus).



Organic Fertiliser:
Processed/ground-up organic material;
Hoof and horn 14% N, 2% P, bone meal 4% N, 20 % P;
A small volume of organic matter with a large amount of nutrients;
Applied in small volumes with high nutrient value, but no effect as a bulky organic material on the soil;
Organic is considered less damaging as it breaks down leaving natural residues in the soil where inorganic leave residue salts.  Inorganic salts can build up (especially in containers).
