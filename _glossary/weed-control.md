`WEED CONTROL`

Control of weeds`

Can include cultural, biological and chemical methods.

Weeds, lawns and other vegetation intercept water before it reaches the roots of newly planted trees and shrubs;

Keep a vegetation-free circle at least 1.2m (4ft) in diameter around the plant for its first three years to help avoid this problem;

The circle can be kept weed free through hoeing or use of contact or systemic weed-killers;

Laying mulch over this circle is also helpful, although take care to leave a collar of 10cm (4in) around the woody stems that is free of mulch, to prevent the risk of rotting the bark.
