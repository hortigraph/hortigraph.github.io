`PALLADIAN BRIDGE`

Palladianism is, loosely, a philosophy of design based on the writings and work of Andreas Palladio, an Italian architect of the 16th century who tried to recreate the style and proportions of the buildings of ancient Rome.`

What characterizes English Palladian architecture? In a nutshell, grace, understated decorative elements, and use of classical orders. At its most rigid, Palladianism simply copied designs made popular in Italy by Palladio.
