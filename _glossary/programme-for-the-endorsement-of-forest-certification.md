`PROGRAMME FOR THE ENDORSEMENT OF FOREST CERTIFICATION`

PEFC Sustainable Timber Certification
The PEFC council (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification schemes) is an independent, non-profit, non-governmental organisation, founded in 1999 which promotes sustainably managed forests through independent, third party certification.

The PEFC provides an assurance mechanism to purchasers of wood and paper products that they are promoting the sustainable management of forests. PEFC is a global umbrella organisation for the assessment and mutual recognition of national forest certification schemes developed in a multi-stakeholder process. These national schemes build upon the inter-governmental processes for the promotion of sustainable forest management, a series of on-going mechanisms supported by 149 governments in the world, covering 85% of the world’s forest area. The

PEFC schemes account for over 126 million hectares of forest, producing millions of tonnes of certified timber for the market - making PEFC the world’s largest certification scheme.`
