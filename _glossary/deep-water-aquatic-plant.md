`DEEP WATER AQUATIC PLANT`

`

These can be bought as container-grown or bare-rooted plants.  Container-grown plants may need potting into larger containers.  Bare-rooted plants should have old roots and large leaves removed before planting.  Newly planted containers may need to be raised on bricks so the plants are not too deep and any leaves that float on the surface are not submerged.  They are then lowered in stages as their leaves reach the surface, until the appropriate depth is reached.
