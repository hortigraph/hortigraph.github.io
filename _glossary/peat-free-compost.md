`PEAT FREE COMPOST`

`

Peat Free:
(Many mixtures have and are still being tried as a replacement for peat).
Coir coconut fibre (oil miles)?? – wet in the bottom of the pot/dry on the top, if  used on its own (good in a mixture); Not very available currently?
Composted green waste, widely used but may Variable in pH and texture ( depending on process and original material, may harbour pathogens though becoming less of a problem as  processing becomes more standard.– 
Composted bark – consistent – you need to learn how to use it.  Use as for peat although proves difficult to manage and produce good plants easily; Recommended by RHS. Sylva fibre
Ericaceous – a loam/peat or peat free compost with a LOW acid pH making it suitable for growing acid loving plants in containers.  Needs to be kept acid by use of acid water/liquid feeds (Miracid) or a top dressing with ericaceous compost.
