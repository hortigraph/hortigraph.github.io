Coral-pink to red fungus strands may be seen on leaves and leaf sheaths binding leaves together.  Affected turf areas are usually more or less circular and vary from 2 to 15 inches in diameter.  When dry, the pink strands resemble red threads;
Conditions favouring disease:  Red thread is most serious during periods of prolonged cool, wet weather, especially on turf deficient in nitrogen.
