`COLOUR THEORY`

`

Colour of walls, garden furniture and plants all change the ‘mood’ of the garden.
A garden of blue and analogous colour (colours next to each other on the colour wheel) may convey a restful mood. A garden planted with a mixture of colourful plants might be referred to as a ‘riot’ of colour.
Colour is relative, so one colour is affected by the colours that surround it.
Colour can create a sense of distance (e.g. blue tends to recede).
Colour can create a sense of warmth e.g a terracotta wall might make a seating area look more ‘cosy’ than a white wall.

The bright sun of the Mediterranean tends to bleach out colours, so bright colours tend to be used.
The softer light of northern more temperate climates lends itself to more subtle colours.
