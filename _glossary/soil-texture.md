`SOIL TEXTURE`

`

Soil texture is defined as the relative amounts of sand, silt and clay particles present in a sample (by %).  This gives a name to a soil.  Soil scientists recognise 17 names or more types of mineral soil textures.  However for gardeners there are 8 basic types:
Sand;
Loamy sand;
Sandy loam;
Medium loam;
Silty loam;
Clay;
Sandy clay;
Clay loam.
Some use the term “the feel of the soil”.

Soil texture determines the soil potential:
Workability;
Field capacity (water holding);
Food holding capacity (clay buffering effect);
Drainage potential;
Warmth and earliness of plant growth and cropping;
And so its use.
