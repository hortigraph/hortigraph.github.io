`HOT BED`

Use can be made of the heat from the composting materials. Especially farm animals manure.


Autumn – dig out the soil from a sunken (insulation) cold frame and fill with 45cm of fresh horse manure, compacting as you go and moistening if needed;
Put a layer of soil over as a root zone (light texture) 15cm deep when compacted;
Heat from the manure will heat the soil as well as the atmosphere of the frame;
Allows for the growing of winter crops such as lettuce, or over-wintering of tender plants;
Summer use for crops such as courgettes or melons (base will be cool but a rich root zone);
Autumn – dig out and use as well-rotted compost.

Below using compost/manure as a heat source - as a propagator:



Long lasting heat source but cools progressively. Hard work to refill each year.


Traditional Pineapple pit using old manure as heat source ( Heligan)






Needs fresh farmyard manure still giving off heat.
