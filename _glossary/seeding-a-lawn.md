Cultivation (digging vs rotavating);
First levelling, consolidate, levelling;
(Rolling);
(Stale seed bed);
Pre-seeding fertiliser raked in;
Sow as soon as conditions suit;
Seed can be stored;
Mark out dimension of lawn;
Select type of mixture required:
Calculate seed quantity to purchase;
Area x sowing rate;
Fine lawn 30gm per m²;
General 20-25gm per m²;
General with Rye grass 15-20gm per m²;
Allow to keep some seed in reserve for patching up.

Sowing:
Sowing by hand or drill: 
Sow half the seeds lengthways;
Sow the other half crossways;
Divide large areas into smaller sections;
Calibrate drill to grass seeds;
Sow during dry, calm weather;
Rake after sowing, protect from birds;
Irrigate if necessary.



After germination:
Roll when grass is 5cm high to firm soil and induce tillering;
Cut with sharp bladed mower (no front roller);
Progressively reduce cut height;
Control weeds, dig out seedlings of perennial weeds and course grasses, Annuals will mow out;
Limit use during first season;
Feed and irrigate;
Watch for damping-off disease (water with a fungicide if necessary).
