`ROCKERY`

`

Ideally constructed to imitate a natural out-crop of stone, exposed by the erosion/weathering of soil on a bank;


Uses:
Can be drawn on in design to use or deal with a bank.  Can be a major feature in its own right;
Provide a planting area for rock garden/alpine plants (hobby/interest);
Often built in conjunction with a water feature (pools, water falls, streams);
(Other ways of providing for growing alpines: raised beds, sinks and troughs, alpine houses/frames).

Ideally sloping;
Sunny aspect (south) not over-hung with trees or shaded by buildings;
Soil naturally light (sandy to loam);
Free draining.  No wet spots at the bottom of the slope (might need drainage);
Free from pernicious weeds (bind weed, couch, and ground elder);
Not in a wind tunnel;
Ideally with irrigation water available.

Materials:
Natural:
Local sedimentary stone (Portland & Purbeck – limestone, Shaftesbury – sandstone (green sand)).  These have lines of strata;
Look natural in the area (cohesive);
Cheaper to purchase and transport;
(The use of Westmorland limestone pavement is ACTIVELY discouraged).

Man-Made:
Cast concrete or tufa:

Rogers “Hollowrock”:
Building:

Start at the bottom with lines of stone to form a line of rock with the lines of strata horizontal and running from stone to stone;
Move up the bank, producing planting ledges;
All stones to be bedded in well for safety;
No air pockets;
Ideally do some planting as you build.
Hazards and Risks:
Weight of stones, back injury, pinched fingers;
Stones wobbling or being slippery if walked on.
