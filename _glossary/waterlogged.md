If prolonged, roots can be damaged/areas of lawns or crops go yellow (due to root damage by the chemicals building up in the soil to toxic levels/alcohols) and death of the grass or plant can occur.  Use of drainage/cultivations/not puddling wet soils/spiking/aeration of lawns are all gardening activities used to avoid or correct the likelihood of water logging`
