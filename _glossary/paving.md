`PAVING`

`

(pre-cast concrete/old quarry stone flooring â€“ broken for crazy paving)
Come in many shapes, sizes, textures, qualities and colours.  Often made to look like natural stone or wood.  Can be used to make geometric patterns, through to using as stepping stones.  Can easily be used to create unity in the design (same slabs being used for paths and patio).  Can be a cheaper option.  Some can be heavy to use.
May not be strong enough for heavy use.  Can break when laying.  Need planning to create geometric patterns.
