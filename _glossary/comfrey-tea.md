`COMFREY TEA`

Ideally obtain and grow the sterile “Bocking 14” strain.

 Steeping method.
Fill container (ideally with a tap) with comfrey leaves and apply a weight.  Wait 3-4 weeks and it will start to drip.  Collect concentrate and dilute to the colour of tea (1 in 10) to use as a liquid feed.  Add more leaves as the level falls in the container (a smelly process). 



Comfrey is high in Potash for flowering and fruiting plants;
(N 0.74    P 0.24    K 1.19%);
Nettle is high in Nitrogen to promote growth in plants;
Mix the two at the making stage or mix concentrates for a general feed;
Both contain trace elements; 
When finished, empty onto the compost heap and cover (smell).
