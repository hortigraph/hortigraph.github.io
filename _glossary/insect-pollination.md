`INSECT POLLINATION`

Flowers, often open and flat, pretty/with lines/spotted, producing scent (especially in winter Sarcococca or bad smelling Arum) producing nectar to attract insects to the flower.  Pollen is larger/sticky/rough which tends to stick to the insect.  The stigma is often sticky, large and flat.  The time of flowers opening may coincide with its pollinator â€“ night for moths.  Bees collect nectar and pollen from the flowers for food and in collecting these transfer pollen from anther to stigma and flower to flower.
