`OFFSET MEASUREMENT`

`

These are the lateral measurements from the base line to fix the positions of the different objects of the work with respect to base line. 
These are generally set at right angle offsets. 
It can also be drawn with the help of a tape.
 There are two kinds of offsets:
1) Perpendicular offsets, and
2) Oblique offsets.

The measurements are taken at right angle to the survey line called perpendicular or right angled offsets.

The measurements which are not made at right angles to the survey line are called oblique offsets or tie line offsets.
