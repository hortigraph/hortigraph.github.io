Useful where area for production is small;
Useful in areas of limited soil;
Uses as little as 10% of water a soil-grown crop would need;
As it is possible to grow crops anywhere, there are likely to be less food miles involved therefore less CO2 impact; Growhouses in inner London and New York
Cost of production means only high-value crops are grown; or quick turnover
High system set up costs (cheap in the long run);
Rock wool is indestructible and cannot be reused or recycled, it must go to land fill;
Energy/cost of material/chemical production.
Cannot survive without skilled staff to set up and monitor, 
Would not work when irregular electricity or main water.
Usually linked to controlled lighting and heating.
