`SOIL MOISTURE DEFICIT`

Available water in soils is lost via a combination of:
 evaporation and 
plant transpiration (evapotranspiration).  
For irrigation it is possible to measure this deficit (potential transpiration) and then replace it by irrigating, 
the idea being to bring the soil back up to field capacity only and not to over-irrigate as water applied after this point is reached will drain away (gravitational water).`
