`STORAGE (PRODUCE)`

`

Storage of produce is affected by respiration:
Controlled atmosphere storage for apples.  In special stores the conditions can be controlled.

Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Levels:
Between 0.5 and 2.5% depending on the cultivar (O2 taken down CO2 taken up and controlled by passing the air though scrubbers).

Relative Humidity:
To 95% reduces transpiration and the fruit losing moisture.

Temperature:
Down to 1ºC. To slow respiration rate.

All very closely monitored.

You in the Home:
Place undamaged apples in a polythene bag with a small hole pierced in it. (O2 taken down, CO2 taken up by the natural respiration) and place in fridge;
Seed storage – foil packet seed (Suttons) are sealed with a low humidity atmosphere; the seeds stay viable for a longer time if unopened than the same seeds in a paper packet;
In the home seeds will store longer if the rate of respiration is lowered.  Store dry seeds in paper packets by placing in:
An air tight container (natural respiration will lower the O2 and raise the CO2);
Place a silica pouch in to lower the relative humidity;
Place in the bottom of the fridge for low temperature, do not freeze.
