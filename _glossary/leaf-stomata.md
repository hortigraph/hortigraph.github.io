`LEAF STOMATA`

Stomata Closure:
Stomata are mostly found on the under surface of leaves and are the main exit point of water from the plant (gases: oxygen/carbon dioxide both in and out).  They control water loss by closing at night (open during the day) also if the leaf wilts the stomata loses its turgidity and so will close (extreme mid-day heat can cause stomata to close).
