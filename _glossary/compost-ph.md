`COMPOST PH`

Lime can be added to the heap to maintain conditions (not acid) as the bacteria like it alkaline.
Compost can get very acid in early stages of composition under 6. An acid compost is usually not finished composting.  Usually as the compost finishes the process the pH corrects to between 6.-7.
