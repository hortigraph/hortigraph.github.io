`UTILITY LAWN`

`

This mixture is composed of bent grass and fescue with the addition of some dwarf perennial ryegrass and smooth-stalked meadow-grass;
This combination gives both fine structure and resilience to wear for pathways and parking areas;
Once established, this mix has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances;
On heavily used areas the tougher ryegrass will predominate whilst in other areas a finer sward will develop.
