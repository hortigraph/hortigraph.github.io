`TRANSPIRATION`

“The passage of water through the plant”, from the root hair to its exit, from the plant via the stomata on the leaf.


“Water loss from the plant by evaporation”;
Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts such as from leaves but also from stems and flowers.  
Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores which are called stomata and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage.
`

The natural cohesion of the water molecule (mini magnets joining) and the adhesion of water (attraction of water to other surfaces) to the sides of the xylem allows the water column to be drawn up the stem by transpirational pull.  As the top water molecule evaporates into the atmosphere of the leaf it pulls the next molecule up.
