`DRAINAGE`

Drainage, in agriculture/horticulture, is the removal of excess water from the soil, either by a system of surface ditches, or by underground conduits if required by soil conditions and land contour.`

* Natural:
* Sandy soils – fast natural movement > dry site/planting (may be improved by adding old organic matter);
* Clay soils – slow > wetter site/planting (may be improved by digging and adding young organic matter);
* High water table – artificial drainage system may be considered to alter the situation.
