`LAWN AERATION`

`

Aerating:
Compaction:
Localised;
Reduced passage of air & build up of CO2;
Reduce passage of water & drainage;
Aeration improves surface drainage;
Improves root activity, reduces moss;
Alteration of soil texture by top dressing;
When to aerate:
Spring/summer: spike localised compaction;
September: deeper, general & hollow-tines;
Winter: localised to disperse standing water.
Smaller lawn areas can be manually aerated using a form inserted into the soil.  Insert tines to approximately four inches and push down – or rock back and forth a bit – loosening the soil, and then pull out.  Repeat this process every 10cm until the entire lawn area is covered;
For larger areas machine spikers are available “Big Willy” fish tail, solid or hollow tines available.
