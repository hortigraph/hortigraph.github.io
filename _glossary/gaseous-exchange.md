`GASEOUS EXCHANGE`

Water evaporates from the xylem in the leaf into the air pockets between the cells (100% relative humidity ) then diffuse out from the stomata in the epidermis of the leaf, into the outside air which is at a lower relative humidity (propagation). This movement produces transpirational pull
Gases such as oxygen/carbon dioxide entering and leaving the plant via stomata of leaves or lenticels on stems.
