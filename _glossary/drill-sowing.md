## DRILL SOWING
### Definition
Method for sowing seeds in shallow trenches, usually in straight lines or geometric patterns so that the gardener can
discern what is weed and what is seed.

### Description
 Use pegs or skewers and string to give you a guideline,
then make a drill with a corner of the hoe or a stick. Be careful not to make it too deep. Water
the trench before sowing the seed. One way is to sprinkle the seed into the palm of one hand
and take pinches with the other to sow as thinly as you can. Another is to tip it slowly out of a
folded piece of paper. If the seed is very fine, mix it with silver sand or a little compost. Cover
the trench, taking care not to bury the seed too deeply. Mark the spot and label it (golden rule).
