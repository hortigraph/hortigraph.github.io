The diffusion of water where water molecules move from an area of high water concentration to an area of lower water concentration through a differentially (semi) permeable membrane.


Soil water (high concentration)/water in cell sap (low concentration).

Water uptake into cells (from soil to root hair/from cell to cell).  As water enters a cell it increases the water concentration to the cell next to it and so water will pass on into the next cell:
