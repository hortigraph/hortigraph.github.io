`LAWN MOWING`

`

Seasonal guide to mowing:
March – top with blade set higher than summer height;
April – increase frequency according to weather;
May-August – adjust to summer height & frequency;
August-September – reduce frequency as growth rate slows;
Late September – adjust height to Autumn height;
October-February – occasional topping during milder weather.

Cut:
Height of cut adjusted as needed by season and weather;
Frequency of mowing as required;
Right conditions, dry / switch off dew;
Removal of mowing and composting;
Boxing off clippings (benefits & limitations);
Allowing clippings to “fly” (+ and -).

How to Mow: 
Plan the direction;
Mow when dry;
Scatter worm casts before mowing;
Rake before to lift unwanted growth; 
Move steadily forward;
Always mow at right-angles
Create stripes:

Start

Many homeowners mistakenly cut their lawns once a week.  Grass should be cut when it needs cutting, rather than mowing on an artificially imposed schedule;
Decades of field research and experience have demonstrated that mowing frequency should generally be stepped up to once every five to six days;

Grass Recycling trades off mowing more frequently with actually spending less time and energy on lawn care.  For example, by grass recycling, you are not stopping every five-ten minutes to empty the mower bag, putting clippings into a bag or container, and dragging heavy clippings to the curb.  In fact, grass recycling typically saves 40 percent of the time traditionally spent on lawn chores.

Mowing problems:
Ribbing – narrow, parallel strip caused by cylinder blade at low speed & low number of blades = few cuts;
Washboard effect – irregular waves or corrugations  caused by grass cut always in same direction;
Lacerated & uneven cutting – caused by blunt & incorrectly set blades;
Scalping – caused by surface irregularities.
