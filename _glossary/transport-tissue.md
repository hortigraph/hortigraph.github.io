`TRANSPORT TISSUE`

`

Transport (phloem & xylem) in vascular bundles/veins each side of the cambium:
Phloem responsible for the translocation of soluble organic materials in the plant (down) – starches and sucrose away from the leaves/auxin from the apical meristems of shoots (translocation).
Xylem responsible for the translocation of materials in the plant (up) – water (transpiration) and minerals.
