`NUTRIENT UPTAKE`

Nutrient from soil solution, active uptake against a concentration gradient into root cells;
Distribution through the phloem;



Uptake of ions across membranes is accomplished by 3 mechanisms:
Simple diffusion – normal diffusion between cells;
Facilitated diffusion – ions combine with a membrane protein which then facilitates its uptake across the cell membrane;
(In both of the above, the partials move down a concentration gradient);
Active transport requiring energy to be exerted (respiration):
Where the mineral needs to move up a concentration gradient, the ion will combine with a membrane protein referred to as a carrier.  The carrier will transport the partial across the membrane.
(Most of this activity takes place via the root hairs).

Minerals:
Ions – once dissolved in the plant cell sap (water) are transported through the plant in the xylem (up the plant).

Distribution Through the Phloem:
Minerals ions once dissolved in the plant cell sap (water) are transported through the plant in the phloem (around the plant);
