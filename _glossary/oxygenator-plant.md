`OXYGENATOR PLANT`

Submerged plants (aka oxygenators)
Submerged plants produce oxygen during the day and provide cover for aquatic life`

Oxygenating plants can be purchased in bunches and are planted into baskets.  They will need anchoring firmly in place.  Approximately four to five bunches, each containing three to four stems, per square metre of water surface should be sufficient.  As these plants respire at night, too many can lead to a lack of oxygen at night during the summer, causing fish to die.  Avoid invasive species such as Myriophyllum aquaticum (Parrotâ€™s Feather).
