`POND BALANCE`

`

Once a balance of plants and animal life is established, the water should remain clear without needing further attention.  However, if you notice any changes in the numbers of fish and plants, the water balance may be slightly off and a surge of algal growth may result;

The addition of oxygenating plants, which are efficient at absorbing minerals and carbon dioxide, helps to starve out the algae.  It's important to remove any rotting organic matter in the pond such as dead leaves and flowers.  A form of algae known as blanket weed is often found in ponds, and if left unchecked can choke the plants and restrict the movement of fish.  Make sure you remove blanket weed periodically by lifting it out with a garden rake.
