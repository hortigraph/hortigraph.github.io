`PED`

Soil peds are natural, relatively permanent aggregates, separated from each other by voids or natural surfaces of weakness. Peds persist through cycles of wetting and drying. Soil Fragments and Clods are artificial structural units, formed at or near the surface by cultivation or frost action, and are not peds.`
