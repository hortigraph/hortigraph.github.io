`PROPORTION`

`

A huge grand house with a small front gate might look ‘out of proportion’
Proportion in a garden relates not only to features in the garden but the relationship of the garden to the house.
Trees and shrubs will grow, their ultimate size will determine whether or not their proportions are suitable.
There are some proportions that seem to work better than others.
