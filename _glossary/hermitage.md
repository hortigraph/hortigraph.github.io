`HERMITAGE`

A hermitage can be two things. In early Christianity, a hermitage was a place where religious men lived on their own to escape the temptations of the world. These retreats were caves or small buildings in deserts, mountains, forests or on islands. In eighteenth-century landscape gardens a hermitage was also a retreat, but for its aristocratic owners to rest in on their walks. These hermitages were also used as eye-catchers in the landscape.
