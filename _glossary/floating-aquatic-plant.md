`FLOATING AQUATIC PLANT`

Floating plants do not need anchorage in soil. Their presence on the surface reduces the amount of sunlight penetrating the water and keeps the water cooler, discouraging algae. Aim to keep around 50% of the surface clear of vegetation, if necessary by thinning occasionally during the summer.`

Introduce floating aquatics to the pool by placing them gently on the waterâ€™s surface.  Clumps may need separating first.  One plant per square metre of surface area should be sufficient.  Avoid invasive floating plants.
