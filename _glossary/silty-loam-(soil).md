`SILTY LOAM (SOIL)`

Basic garden soil type`

Sand 20%;                                         Silt 50%;                                      Clay 30%.
A sticky feel when hand tested.  Heavy (not so easily worked as clay that will respond to weathering and liming).  Wet in winter, no buffering effect.  Bakes hard in summer. Limited period for working/cultivating
