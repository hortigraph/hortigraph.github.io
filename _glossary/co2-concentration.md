`CO2 CONCENTRATION`

Normal air is 300ppm which in good conditions gives 100% plant growth.  By artificially raising it to 450ppm gives 150% growth and 600ppm gives 200% growth.  It is normal practice to raise CO2 in greenhouses to increase the quality (weight) of crops by burning gas in the greenhouse.
