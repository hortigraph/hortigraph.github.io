`COMPOST NUTRIENTS`

The nutrient content of compost is variable according to the methods of making/ materials used/amount of leaching, etc.  Differing amounts given in books:
N 1.5-2.5    P2O5 0.2-0.5    K2O 1–2%;
N 1.5    P2O5 2    K2O 0.5%;
Worm N 1.5-2.2    P2O5 0.8–02.2    K2O 1–1.5%.
All levels are low compared with fertilisers’ but the volumes applied make compost a good way of applying nutrients to the soil, particularly when you take into account the fact that compost contains a full range of micro and trace elements.
