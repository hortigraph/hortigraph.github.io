`NUTRIENT RELEASE`

The plant food content of bulky organic matter (BOM) is broken down (mostly by bacteria) and so released and recycled back to the plants.  Commonly talked about is the nitrogen cycle where several different bacteria are involved in breaking down BOM resulting in the release of nitrates into the soil. Nitrates are the form of nitrogen taken up by plants.`
