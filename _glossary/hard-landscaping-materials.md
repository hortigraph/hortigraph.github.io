`HARD LANDSCAPING MATERIALS`

Understand the effective and appropriate use of hard landscaping materials.

Hard landscaping predominantly uses hard materials, like stone, wood, concrete, bricks, paving, and metals, rather than “soft” soil, plants and planting.
`

How to use hard landscaping to create cohesion in garden design?
Use identical materials to those that the house is built in for paths/walls;
Reflect any motif or pattern used in the house, perhaps on a building or seat;
Use local stone where available to link with the landscape/buildings or walls;
Use a limited number of hard landscape materials;
Consider the scale and proportion of features;
Consider the use of colours and styles to be appropriate to the site.
