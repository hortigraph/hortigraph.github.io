`SOIL DRAINAGE`

`

Identify poor drainage:
Surface symptoms – indicator plants (rushes, reeds, moss, buttercups, docks).  Laying water.  Yellow patches in crops/lawns;
Pit test – high water table, soil smell (sour/metallic), soil colour (grey mottling/or rust patches);
Obvious surface run off – paths/patio/bases of banks.
