`FERTILISER`

Providing plants with direct sources of nutrients.
A substance containing a high proportion of plant food or foods related to its volume (organic fertiliser applied by the gram/bulky organic matter low in foods applied by the barrow full).
Fertilizers (or fertilisers) are substances that supply plant nutrients or amend soil fertility. 

They are the most effective (30 -80 per cent increase in yields) means of increasing crop production and of improving the quality of food and fodder.

 Fertilizers are used in order to supplement nutrient supply in the soil, especially to correct yield-limiting factors.

Fertilizers are applied to promote plant growth; the main nutrients present in fertilizer are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (the 'macronutrients') and other nutrients ('micronutrients’) are added in smaller amounts. 

Fertilizers are usually directly applied to soil, and can also be sprayed on leaves as a foliar feeding.

Works immediately : In-organic fertilizers do not need a certain time to be broken down or decomposed before usage because these contain nutrients that can be readily absorbed by plants.

Contains all necessary nutrients that are ready to use: Inorganic fertilizers are designed to give plants all the nutrients, Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium that they need in appropriate proportions and amounts

Leeching happens

Inorganic fertilizers contain nutrients that have been broken down already into the most basic of its components for easy absorption by the plants. 

Yet, it can also be washed away easily when watering or irrigating the plants. 

This is called leeching. Leeching happens very often as you water your plants. 

Hence, a lot of the fertilizer goes to waste.

 Nitrogen is one of the elements that easily get washed away since it usually settles below the roots of the plants quickly.

When you’re using inorganic fertilizers you need to pay special attention to the roots of the plant when you’re watering it and not over water the area so that you’re not encouraging the leeching of the nutrients in the soil.

Accumulation of toxic wastes

Inorganic fertilizers are not entirely composed of the nutrients needed by the plants. It also contains salts and other compounds. 

These are not absorbed by the plants so they are left behind in the soil and build up over time.

 When found in large amounts in the soils, these compounds can alter the chemistry of the soil that makes it less ideal for planting.

 Over times, the soil needs to be neutralized using other substances to return it to a normal state that is suitable for planting

Too much is not a good thing

Fertilizers are good sources of nutrients for plants. 

However, too much of it can also be harmful to the plants. 

Applying the fertilizer directly to the plants may burn the delicate plant structures such as the roots. 

This could affect the over-all development of the plant.

Inorganic fertilizers have both good and bad points. 

Should you consider using them, better maximize and the advantages and try to prevent all its avoidable disadvantages.
