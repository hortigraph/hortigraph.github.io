message: "What you composed made a ton of sense. However, consider this, suppose \r\nyou were to write a awesome post title? I ain't saying your content is not good, however suppose you added a post title that \r\ngrabbed people's attention? I mean Describe methods of composting and their use/application in horticultural practices.\r\n- Hortigraph is kinda vanilla. You could glance at Yahoo's front page and note how they create post titles to grab viewers to click.\r\nYou might add a video or a pic or two to get people excited about what \r\nyou've written. Just my opinion, it would bring your blog a little livelier."
