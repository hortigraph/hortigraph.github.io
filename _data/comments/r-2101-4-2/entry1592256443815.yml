  Greetings, I was just checking out your site and submitted this message via
  your "contact us" form. The "contact us" page on your site sends you messages
  like this to your email account which is the reason you're reading my message
  right now correct? This is half the battle with any kind of advertising,
  getting people to actually READ your ad and I did that just now with you! If
  you have an advertisement you would like to blast out to tons of websites via
  their contact forms in the US or anywhere in the world send me a quick note
  now, I can even focus on specific niches and my charges are super reasonable.
