> **State how the ideas of ‘reduce, re-use,
reclaim, recycle’ can be applied during the
construction of a garden, to include: transport
and waste disposal issues, on-site working
practices (not leaving water running for
example)** 


`SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION`
Use of renewable timber supplies such as willow or hazel hurdles for screening;
Use lime mortar to build brick walls rather than cement which uses a lot of energy in its production;
Do not waste materials by poor storage/gravel lost in mud – turn off water taps.

`PROGRAMME FOR THE ENDORSEMENT OF FOREST CERTIFICATION`
PEFC Sustainable Timber Certification
The PEFC council (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification schemes) is an independent, non-profit, non-governmental organisation, founded in 1999 which promotes sustainably managed forests through independent, third party certification.

The PEFC provides an assurance mechanism to purchasers of wood and paper products that they are promoting the sustainable management of forests. PEFC is a global umbrella organisation for the assessment and mutual recognition of national forest certification schemes developed in a multi-stakeholder process. These national schemes build upon the inter-governmental processes for the promotion of sustainable forest management, a series of on-going mechanisms supported by 149 governments in the world, covering 85% of the world’s forest area. The

PEFC schemes account for over 126 million hectares of forest, producing millions of tonnes of certified timber for the market - making PEFC the world’s largest certification scheme.
