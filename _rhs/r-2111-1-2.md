title: Describe the potential restrictions which may limit work on the site, including financial constraints; difficulties with access for plant, equipment and materials; topography (degree and extent of slopes); boundary constraints and restrictions on the time the works can be carried out. Completion of work in stages to suit client’s cash-flow, access points for plant and equipment, delivery of materials, the need to negotiate work at boundaries with neighbours, seasonal restrictions to the timing of work (day length, weather) and legal restrictions (local byelaws). Ways to overcome restricted access.

`WORK RESTRICTION`

Describe potential restrictions which may limit work on the site including:
Financial constraints – £££ to spend;
Difficulties with access for plant (machinery) – work having to be done by hand;
Equipment and materials (access, cost, availability);
Topography (degree and extent of slopes):
Access for machinery;
Need for bigger machines;
Volume of material to be moved (cut and fill) to level an area;
Amount of building to retain slopes (retaining walls);
Need for drainage.
Boundary constraints – access/ownership;
Restriction on time the work can be carried out in:
Weather breaking = need to complete quicker;
Need for quick make over;
