`ALPINE PLANT`
Although the term 'alpine and rock garden plant' is often used to include low-growing rock garden plants that may be grown successfully at relatively low altitudes, strictly speaking, alpine plants are those that originate at high altitudes above the tree line


`ROCK GARDEN`

`ROCK GARDEN PLANT`
A true alpine plant or not, displaying an abundance of attractive, brightly coloured flowers, and their diminutive form and compact habit make them particularly suitable for growing in a relatively small space.
