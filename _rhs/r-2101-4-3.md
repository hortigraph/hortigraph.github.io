title: Describe the movement of water and minerals through the plant.
---


> **Distinguish between diffusion and osmosis to
include: gaseous and liquid diffusion,
transpiration, and water uptake. Identify examples
of diffusion in plants, to include: transpiration and
gaseous exchange.** 

> **Identify examples of osmosis in plants, to include:
water uptake into cells, turgor, and cell expansion.** 

> **Describe the pathway of water movement from
the soil through the plant into the atmosphere -
soil water: pathway across the root (root hairs,
osmosis across root cells, flow through root cell
walls, endodermis); transport through xylem of
stem (transpiration pull): pathway across leaf,
(xylem in veins, osmosis across leaf cells, flow
through leaf cell walls, evaporation from leaf cell
walls into mesophyll spaces); diffusion through
stomata of leaf.** 

> **DIAGRAM OF PATHWAY REQUIRED.** 

> **State what is meant by the term ‘transpiration’.
List the factors that affect the rate of transpiration:
relative humidity, temperature, wind speed.** 

> **Describe how the plant may limit water loss, to
include: stomatal closure and leaf adaptations
(hairs, thick cuticle, needles). ONE named plant
example should be known for EACH adaptation.** 

> **Describe the uptake and distribution of mineral
nutrients in the plant: nutrients from soil solution
active uptake against concentration gradient into
root cells, transport through the plant in xylem,
distribution through phloem.**
