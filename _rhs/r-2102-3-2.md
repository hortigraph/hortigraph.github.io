title: Explain the significance of soil pH to plant growth.
---


> **Describe what is meant by the pH terms: acidic,
neutral and alkaline/basic.** 


`PH SCALE`
he concept of pH was introduced by Danish chemist Soren Sorensen in 1909.  The exact meaning of p is unknown, often referred to as “Power of Hydrogen” or some say “Potential Hydrogen”.

The pH of a solution is a measurement of its acidity or alkalinity and is defined as “The negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration”.


The full scale runs from 1 to 14 and is logarithmic;
7 is considered as neutral – neither acidic nor alkaline;
Below 7 is the acid range;
Above 7 is the alkaline range;

`POWER OF HYDROGEN`

`POTENTIAL HYDROGEN`

`ACIDITY`

`ALKILINITY`
> **State the pH range found in garden soils (approx
4 – 8).** 


`SOIL PH`
The range of garden soils is given by the RHS as 4-8 though some books go to 8.5.

State why 6.5 is the most suitable pH for a wide range of plants in the British Isles.


Normally:
Plant growth of a great range of plants is good in the range of 6→7.5;
A good pH for most gardens is 6.5 as it suits “most plants” and most plant nutrients are readily available (this alters slightly according to the soil’s texture).

Soil Structure (soil organisms, crumb formation):
Worms dislike acid soils and so such soils have few worms.  Worms secret alginate into the soil that acts as a soil glue creating good soil structure.  Calcium products can be used to help break down clay soils chemically, so improving the structure (calcium carbonate and hydroxide will alter the soil pH, calcium sulphate will not).
Soils with natural high free lime content (calcareous clay) will not respond to the application of lime products.

Nutrient Availability:
See above.  Nutrient availability is affected by both soil pH and soil texture. 

Lime Induced Chlorosis:
Where the free lime in the soil locks up iron and magnesium molecules in the soil and makes them unavailable to the plants.  This causes a mineral deficiency with iron showing up as yellow young leaves and magnesium as yellow inter-venial patches on old leaves (treat plants with sequestrene of iron).

`CALCIFUGE`
acid-loving lime-hating
True Acid Loving Plants (or calcifuge lime hating):
Such as Rhododendrons “Pink Pearl”, Camellia “Donation”, Pieris japonica need acid soils pH range of 4.5 →6.5.

`CALCICOLE`
lime-loving, acid-hating
True Acid Haters (calcicole lime loving):
Such as Clematis tangutica, Dianthus barbatus, Viburnum tinus need alkaline soil pH 7.25 and above 8.

`SOIL AMENDMENT`
altering soil ph etcd


`LIME`

`CALCIUM CARBONATE`
see also calcium hydroxide
will raise the soil pH;
Fairly cheap to purchaser;
Quick effect on soil.

Limitations:
Careful calculation of application rate required so as not to under or over dose the soil.

Environmental:
Implication of energy used in processing;
Once applied, effect lasts for several years.

Health and Safety:
Burning of eyes Or exposed skin, 
Should not breathe in dry powder.

Timing of application:
Autumn – and allow to be washed into the soil;
Must not come into contact with farmyard manures.

Effectiveness of the material:
Very effective;
You need to apply more carbonate to have the same effect as hydroxide.


`CALCIUM HYDROXIDE`
see also calcium carbonate
will raise the soil pH;
Fairly cheap to purchaser;
