> **State that the presence of underground
services (drainage, water, sewage, gas, oil,
electricity, cable TV) may limit where
excavations can safely be made, and
overhead cables may restrict site access for
equipment and large plants. Implications of
damaging services in addition to health and
safety: cost, inconvenience, damage to soil.** 


`OVERHEAD SERVICE`

State why it is necessary to identify the existence of overhead and underground services:
Health and safety issues;
Soil movement/levelling can alter the depth cables are under the ground;
Planning of planting:
Do not plant trees under overhead lines;
Or plant trees over sewage pipes where the roots can enter via damaged pipes and cause pipes to block up.


`UNDERGROUND SERVICE`

State why it is necessary to identify the existence of overhead and underground services:
Health and safety issues;
Soil movement/levelling can alter the depth cables are under the ground;
Planning of planting:
Do not plant trees under overhead lines;
Or plant trees over sewage pipes where the roots can enter via damaged pipes and cause pipes to block up.
