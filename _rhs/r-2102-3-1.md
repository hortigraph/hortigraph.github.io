title: Describe a range of nutrients required for healthy plant growth.

> **Major: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
magnesium.** 


`PLANT NUTRIENT REQUIREMENTS`

Nitrogen   N;
Phosphorus (Phosphates)   P2O5;
Potassium   K2O;
(commonly referred to as N.P.K.);
Calcium;
Magnesium.

Minor (trace) nutrients:
Iron;
The following are trace elements, : Manganese, Boron, Copper, Zinc, Molybdenum, Sulphur, (Chlorine Sodium).


`NITROGEN`

Major requirement for growth in the plant;
Associated with green leaves and shoots;
Also in chlorophyll;
Promotes growth.


`PHOSPHOROUS`

Associated with energy in the meristems/growing tips of roots and shoots and also respiration;
Promotes root growth – added to seed compost;
Applied in autumn to lawns to toughen the grass up for winter, makes it more resistant to cold, allows roots to anchor and grow.


`PHOSPHATES`

`POTASSIUM`

Involved in resistance to chilling, drought and diseases;
Associated with flower and fruit production.

`NPK`

`CALCIUM`
Constituent of cell walls and also influences the activity of meristems especially root tips.


`MAGNESIUM`
Constituent of chlorophyll, activation of enzymes and movement of phosphates;
Green leaves;
Feed show plants often to darken the leaves.



`CHEMICAL ELEMENT`

`N (CHEMICAL ELEMENT)`
nitrogen


`K2O (CHEMICAL ELEMENT)`
potassium


`P2O5 (CHEMICAL ELEMENT)`
phosphorous


`TRACE ELEMENT`

`MANGANESE`

`BORON`

`COPPER`

`MOLYBDENUM`

`SULPHUR`

`CHLORINE`

`SODIUM`
> **Minor: Iron.** 


`IRON`
In chlorophyll. Most available in low pH soils

> **State ONE role of EACH of these nutrients in the
plant.** 


`NITROGEN`

Major requirement for growth in the plant;
Associated with green leaves and shoots;
Also in chlorophyll;
Promotes growth.


`PHOSPHOROUS`

Associated with energy in the meristems/growing tips of roots and shoots and also respiration;
Promotes root growth – added to seed compost;
Applied in autumn to lawns to toughen the grass up for winter, makes it more resistant to cold, allows roots to anchor and grow.


`POTASSIUM`

`CALCIUM`
Constituent of cell walls and also influences the activity of meristems especially root tips.


`MAGNESIUM`
Constituent of chlorophyll, activation of enzymes and movement of phosphates;
Green leaves;
Feed show plants often to darken the leaves.



`IRON`
In chlorophyll. Most available in low pH soils

> **Describe the visual symptoms of deficiency of
EACH nutrient listed above.** 


`NITROGEN DEFICIENCY`
Stunted growth, pale green/small leaves;
Apples – leaves going red early autumn and falling early, thin poor growth, much die back as bud die, few flowers, fruit small but highly coloured.



`NITROGEN TOXICITY`
Cabbages – very large leaves, dark green, collapsing in rain, white blister.
Soft growth prone to botrytus



`PHOSPHOROUS DEFICIENCY`
Lack of growth and flowers the same as nitrogen;
Autumn colour purple and bronze;
Fruit green and sharp;
Deficiency showing most late season July/August; 
Worst on chalk soils. 



`PHOSPHOROUS TOXICITY`

`POTASSIUM DEFICIENCY`
Short growth and much die back;
Leaves bluish-green with slight chlorosis;
Edges of leaves brown and die (marginal scorch);
Less flowers and fruit;
Fruit falls early looking immature but is sweet, lacking acid;
Known antagonism with magnesium (ratio 3/1 potassium to magnesium). 


`POTASSIUM TOXICITY`

`CALCIUM DEFICIENCY`
Shows up in individual plants as bitter pit of apples, blossom end-rot of tomato, black-heart of celery, internal browning of Brussels sprouts, tip-burn of lettuce.


`CALCIUM TOXICITY`

`MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY`
Old leaves chlorotic between veins – this dies out leaving inter-venial patches (common on raspberries on chalk soils and tomato). 



`MAGNESIUM TOXICITY`

`IRON DEFICIENCY`
Young leaves all yellow/bright yellow tips;
Marginal scorch, die back of growth;
Usually lime induced.


`IRON TOXICITY`

`PHOSPHOROUS DEFICIENCY`
Lack of growth and flowers the same as nitrogen;
Autumn colour purple and bronze;
Fruit green and sharp;
Deficiency showing most late season July/August; 
Worst on chalk soils.

phosphorus on plant growth and development
