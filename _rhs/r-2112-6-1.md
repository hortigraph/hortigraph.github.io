title: State appropriate grass mixtures for the establishment of a high quality ornamental lawn and for a hard-wearing utility lawn.
---


> **State a mix of grass species for
an ornamental lawn Examples could include:
Agrostis capillaris+ Festuca rubra subsp.
commutata and
a utility lawn which must include Lolium
perenne, plus others such as  Festuca rubra
rubra,  Poa pratensis, Agrostis capillaris** 


`LAWN`

Easily maintained ground cover;
Links areas of a garden;
Retain colour throughout the year;
Cover slopes;
Recreation area;
Create a vista leading to a focal point;
Fills in space between features.


`GRASS SEED`

Sowing seed (Autumn and Spring):
Benefits:
Cheaper;
Big choice of mixture;
Seeds can be stored;
Sowing can be delayed;
May need irrigation.
Limitations:
Long to establish;
Needs good soil preparation;
Need to control weeds;
Dependent on good weather;
Needs protection from birds / wind / frost;
Risks of disturbance of seedbed by birds / cats.


`GRASS SEED MIX`

`ORNAMENTAL LAWN`

Fine Amenity Turfgrass Mixture, Composition:
This mixture is composed of top quality, fine leaved varieties of bent and fescue grasses;
The choice of varieties means that this mixture is ideal for producing a first class lawn but also has the qualities required for a low maintenance grass sward.

`UTILITY LAWN`

This mixture is composed of bent grass and fescue with the addition of some dwarf perennial ryegrass and smooth-stalked meadow-grass;
This combination gives both fine structure and resilience to wear for pathways and parking areas;
Once established, this mix has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances;
On heavily used areas the tougher ryegrass will predominate whilst in other areas a finer sward will develop.
