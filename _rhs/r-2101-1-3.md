> **Describe the stages of the life-cycle of a plant:
seed, juvenile (vegetative), adult (reproductive),
senescence, death and their significance for
horticulture.** 


`SEED`
Seed is formed from the ovule after fertilisation (often enclosed within the fruit, e.g., apple pip). The EMBRYO of a new plant
Natural regeneration of the plant, a means of distribution and protection of the embryo, may impose dormancy (hard seed coat: Lathyrus or immature embryo: Ginkgo), give rise to a new plant.



`JUVENILE (LIFE CYCLE)`
The non-reproductive stage of plant life cycle, prior to ADULT


`ADULT (LIFE CYCLE)`
The life cycle stage of a plant in which it is capable of SEXUAL REPRODUCTION. Follows the JUVENILE (LIFE CYCLE) stage and preceeds SENESCENCE.


`SENESCENCE`
The stage of a plant life cycle when it begins to die. Fruiting an flowering cease. Autumn leaf colour is an example of plant senescence


`DEATH (LIFE CYCLE)`
The final stage of plant lifecycle at which metabolic processes cease and cells die


 - EMBRYO is enclosed in a `TESTA`
 - Has a FOOD STORE in the `COTYLEDONS` or `ENDOSPERM` 
 - Plant is `DORMANT`
 - Plant has LOW `RESPIRATION`
 - Method of `DISTRIBUTION`
 - Can be short or long period before germination

- Period of `VEGETATIVE GROWTH`
- NON-`FLOWERING`
- NON-SEXUAL
- Can have different characteristics from Adult

Plant starts to FLOWER, and produce FRUIT and SEED (`SEXUAL REPRODUCTION`)
 - Often the stage for which the plant is grown (Enjoy flowers, harvest fruit)
 - Adult material can be grafted onto juvenile root stock to speed development ( e.g. *Wisteria sinensis*)

 - FLOWERING and FRUITING CEASE
 - LEAVES show `AUTUMN COLOUR`

- `METABOLIC PROCESSES` CEASE (`PHOTOSYNTHESIS`, `RESPIRATION`)
- `CELL` DEATH
