> **State what is meant by seasonal displays
including when the plants can be planted out.
The terms Hardy and Half-hardy should be
defined in relation to temperature tolerance
(either in degrees Celsius or Zones) as well
as plant husbandry.** 


`BEDDING`
Bedding, in horticulture, refers to the temporary planting of fast-growing plants into flower beds to create colourful, temporary, seasonal displays, during spring, summer or winter. Plants used for bedding are generally annuals, biennials or tender perennials; succulents and tropical plants are gaining in popularity.
A plant that has already been grown to blooming or near-blooming size before being planted out, usually in a formal area for seasonal display;

Bedding plants are really all plants that, irrespective of their growing habits, are used to make a temporary show;

For example, hardy bulbs (Hyacinths and Tulips), hardy and half-hardy perennials (Chrysanthemums), and even tender shrubs (Castor Oil Plant);

But 'bedding' is usually taken to mean those half-hardy annuals or half-hardy perennials planted out to make a splash of colour in the summer, spring or winter;

`HARDY ANNUAL`
Can be sown in situ


`HALF HARDY ANNUAL`
A tender annual usually sown under protection early in the season then possibly planted out.
Half-hardy perennials / annuals (tender perennials / annuals);

Will not survive frost and must be brought indoors during the winter;

Examples: Pelargonium, Fuchsia, and Heliotrope;

Individual microclimates and good free-draining soil can make an enormous difference to their ability to survive the winter;

Half-hardy annual plants can survive a couple of brushes with chilly night temperatures (35 – 45ºF) and light frost, but anything colder will turn them to mush;

Just like hardy annuals, the longer they’ve had to get used to the 

`TEMPERATURE HARDINESS HALF HARDY`

`HARDY PLANT`
Capable of withstanding cold or extreme weather conditions all year round when grown outside.


`TENDER PLANT`
A plant not capable of surviving cold or extreme weather. May include perennials and annuals.


`TROPICAL PLANT`
Bedding display made of a range (mainly large plants) of half-hardy, and tender annual and perennial plants to recreate a jungle effect.
Tropical bedding displays can present a tapestry of magnificent colours and textures with plants that were popular in Victorian gardens and traditional bedding schemes;

With their bold leaves and distinctive colours, the stars are always Cannas, Coleus, and Begonia;
Many flowering plants also provide vivid colour while maintaining tropical appeal like Fuchsias, Hibiscus, and Canna;

There are a number of foliage plants that can be incorporated into the tropical border;

Foliage plants give tropical borders height and texture, while mimicking the look and feel of a real jungle oasis;

Anything ranging through from Hostas, Ferns and Elephant Ears to Bamboos, Palms and Ornamental Grasses – the possibilities are endless;

Examples: Canna indica, Ricinus communis.

`EDGING PLANT`
Low growing plants positioned at the rim of the bed or border;
Dwarf plants up to 20cm

`GROUNDWORK PLANT`
Medium-height varieties reaching 8” – 2’ filling most of the bed, planted according to size 20-30 cm apart;


`INFILL PLANT`
Another name for GROUNDWORK PLANTs


`DOT PLANT`
These are plants, usually of a contrasting shape, used through the groundwork to break it up and give a different texture or shape.  Intermediate in height between the groundwork and standards;
