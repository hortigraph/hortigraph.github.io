`PLANT CELL`

![Typical Plant Cell Unlabled](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xRh5LXXB0eJ2u_g7JX_8-Kixj24a1nASXdbrR0oZN2XggT7-gGth5Zreq2ivxxizFCgZ5GYcNlvIdQ "Typical Plant Cell Unlabled")

**REQUIRED LABELS**

 1. `CELL WALL` (Outer)
 2. `CELL MEMBRANE` (Inner)
 3. `CYTOPLASM` 
 4. `CHLOROPLAST` (Larger)
 5. `MITOCHONDRION` (Smaller)
 6. `VACUOLE`
 7. `NUCLEUS`
> **State the function of: cell wall, cell membrane,
nucleus, vacuole, cytoplasm, chloroplast &
mitochondrion.** 


`CELL WALL`
 - **Controls the shape** of the cell
 - Limits cell expansion


`CELL MEMBRANE`
 - **Controls movement** of substances **in and out** of the cell (it is `SELECTIVELY PERMEABLE`)


`SELECTIVELY PERMEABLE`

`NUCLEUS`
 - **Contains genetic information** so **controls cell processes**


`VACUOLE`
 - Controls cell `TURGOR`
 - Stores waste products


`CELL TURGOR`

`CYTOPLASM`
 - Enables **substances** to **transported within** the cell


`CHLOROPLAST`
 - The **SITE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS** in the cell
 - **Contains** `CHLOROPHYLL` used as a `CATALYST` in `PHOTOSYNTHESIS`


`CHLOROPHYLL`

`CATALYST`

`MITOCHONDRION`
 * Perform `RESPIRATION` to **release energy**

> **Describe where cell division is located within the
plant - apical and lateral meristems.** 


`CELL DIVISION`
 1. `CELL DIVISION`
         - The `ZONE OF CELL DIVISION`
         - `MERISTEMATIC` cells **DIVIDE**
         - These are basic, `UNDIFFERENTIATED CELLS`


`MERISTEMATIC CELLS`
`MERISTEMATIC` cells are those with the **power of division**


`APICAL MERISTEM`
 - `APICAL MERISTEM`: 
         - In **shoots** (Buds) & 
         - **root tips**
Cell division.
Zone of elongation – cells elongate giving growth.
Zone of differentiation/maturation – layers of tissues form.
Root hairs – produce a vast surface area for water and mineral uptake.

`LATERAL MERISTEM`
 - `LATERAL MERISTEM`:
         - **Lateral** (sideways) **growth**
         - `SECONDARY THICKENING`
         - The `CAMBIUM` layer in `VASCULAR BUNDLES`


`CAMBIUM`
Cell division/responsible for secondary thickening, producing new xylem and phloem.


`VASCULAR BUNDLE`
Vascular bundle in dicots – are the conductive bundles protected in sheaths of phloem/xylem/cambium – can be strengthening in the stem. (No cambium in monocots).



`SECONDARY THICKENING`
> **Describe how plants increase in size – cell
division and enlargement (NO DETAILS OF
MITOSIS ARE REQUIRED).** 


`ZONE OF CELL DIVISION`

`CELL ELONGATION`
 2. `CELL ELONGATION`
         - The `ZONE OF CELL ELONGATION`
         - The divided cells the **ELONGATE**


`ZONE OF CELL ELONGATION`

`CELL DIFFERENTIATION`
3. `CELL DIFFERENTIATION`
         - The `ZONE OF CELL DIFFERNTIATION`
         - The elongated cells **DIFFERENTIATE**
         - The `DIFFERENTIATED CELLS` form specialised `PLANT TISSUES`


`ZONE OF CELL DIFFERENTIATION`

`DIFFERENTIATED CELLS`
         - The `DIFFERENTIATED CELLS` form specialised `PLANT TISSUES`


`UNDIFFERENTIATED CELLS`
