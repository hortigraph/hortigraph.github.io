title: Describe photosynthesis and the factors that affect it.
---


> **State the equation for photosynthesis in words
(carbon dioxide, water, sugars, oxygen) and state
the necessity for chlorophyll and light.** 

> **List the environmental factors that affect the rate
of photosynthesis:
temperature, light (intensity, quality/PAR and
duration), carbon dioxide, water and mineral
nutrients.** 

> **State the equation for photosynthesis in words
NO DETAILS OF WAVELENGTH ABSORPTION
& ACTION SPECTRA ARE REQUIRED.** 

> **Describe how these factors affect the rate of
photosynthesis: to include Law of Limiting Factors
and how growers can optimise the conditions for
photosynthesis.** 

> **NO DETAILS OF METHODS ARE REQUIRED.**
