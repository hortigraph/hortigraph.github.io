Identify the environmental implications of growing plants in water culture.

Useful where area for production is small;
Useful in areas of limited soil;
Uses as little as 10% of water a soil-grown crop would need;
As it is possible to grow crops anywhere, there are likely to be less food miles involved therefore less CO2 impact; Growhouses in inner London and New York
Cost of production means only high-value crops are grown; or quick turnover
High system set up costs (cheap in the long run);
Rock wool is indestructible and cannot be reused or recycled, it must go to land fill;
Energy/cost of material/chemical production.
Cannot survive without skilled staff to set up and monitor, 
Would not work when irregular electricity or main water.
Usually linked to controlled lighting and heating.



`HYDROPONICS`
“Growing plants in water culture”.
There are 2 common methods NFT (nutrient film technique) and substrate culture (rock wool);
Widely used in the commercial production of salad crops under glass.
Water Quality:
Good clean water supply required (tap);
This is filtered as it circulates and passed through an ultra violet light tube to control pathogens and algae growth.

Pest/Disease Control (water quality/pathogens):
As the whole system is very intensive in many ways (for maximum growth) everything is geared up – maximum solution/correct pH/high growing temperature/high light intensity.  If anything goes wrong it can quickly spread and the whole crop lost very quickly (a waterborne pathogen can be circulated through the whole crop in a matter of hours).  It is usual to use preventative rather than creative measures.
Automation of the system is possible.

disease control, automation.** 


`AERATION (HYDROPONICS)`
NFT rely on the water film where the roots grow thin and so are well aerated;
Rock wool growbags drain so not becoming water logged;
Some commercial systems will make use of an air pump in the solution tank to ensure the solution is saturated with oxygen.



`NUTRIENTS (HYDROPONICS)`
ALL minerals needed by the crop are supplied in a solution;
Differing solutions are used to suit the crop/stages of growth/often recycled;
Changed periodically.
These are very closely monitored and altered/topped up as required/ changed periodically;
Ideally maintained at 21ºC.



`PH (HYDROPONICS)`
The ideal pH for the solution is between 5.5-6.5 for mineral availability.  This is adjusted as required by the addition of proprietary products (pH up/pH down).

water culture, to include: NFT (nutrient film
technique), substrate culture (rockwool).** 


`NFT (ACRONYM)`
nutrient-film-technique


`NUTRIENT FILM TECHNIQUE`
Widely used in the commercial production of salad crops under glass.
  







NFT
Plants are held in growing channels and the nutrient solution is introduced at the top of a gentle slope, this then passes down, passing or washing the roots of the crop.  It is collected at the bottom and recirculated back to the header tank.





`SUBSTRATE CULTURE`
Rock Wool/Substrate Culture:
With this method the crop is grown in grow bags containing a root zone of rock wool and the nutrient solution dripped on to the rock wool.  Ideally the rate of drip is regulated so there is little drainage from the bag. 






`ROCKWOOL`
