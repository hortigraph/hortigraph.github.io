<p>LEARNING OUTCOME 3 OF 4</p>
<p>UNDERSTAND PLANT NUTRITION PROVIDED BY SOIL AND OTHER MEDIA</p>
<p>3.3 Describe how plant nutrients can be provided and maintained</p>
<h2 id="of-5-identify-the-characteristics-of-organic-and-inorganic-sources-of-nutrients">1 of 5) IDENTIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANIC AND INORGANIC SOURCES OF NUTRIENTS</h2>
<p><em>ORGANIC</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contain <em>carbon</em></li>
<li><em>Plant</em> - or <em>animal-based</em></li>
<li><em>Living Organic Matter</em>:<br>
Worms/bacteria/fungi/nematodes/moles/plant roots.<br>
â€¢ <em>Byproduct</em> of living animals or <em>end product</em> of death / decomposition:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Dead Organic Matter</em>:<br>
Worms/bacteria/fungi/nematodes/moles/plant roots, plus plant remains (natural or added as compost)</p>
<p><em>Animal by-products</em> (manure/bones/hooves/blood).</p>
<p>*Farmyard manure ðŸ˜˜<br>
â€¢ becomes Humus.<br>
â€¢ physical and chemical effects on the soil<br>
â€¢ generally acidifying.</p>
<p><em>Garden compost:</em><br>
â€¢ can be richer in plant foods;<br>
â€¢ unpredictable nutrient content.</p>
<p><em>Leaf mould</em><br>
â€¢ good physical effect on soil structure<br>
â€¢ limited foods value<br>
â€¢ time to produce</p>
<p><em>Quick Breakdown Mulches</em><br>
â€¢ Well rotted or coarse compost, strawy manure<br>
â€¢ breaks down to become Humus over a season<br>
â€¢ has other benefits eg reduce weeds, retain moisture as with slow breakdown mulches</p>
<p><em>Slow breakdown mulches:</em><br>
â€¢ Un- or incompletely- composted materials eg Bark, wood shaving, shredded paper<br>
â€¢ Breaks down over several seasons but used mostly for weed control and prevention of soil capping<br>
â€¢ Uses nitrogen as it breaks down which may affect fertility of soil for surrounding plants.</p>
<p><em>Humus:</em><br>
â€¢ Remains of bulky organic matter in the soil after decompostion<br>
â€¢ holds plant foods and water<br>
â€¢ creates soil structure</p>
<p><em>INORGANIC:</em><br>
â€¢ <em>Mineral or synthetic</em><br>
â€¢ Often <em>Manufactured</em></p>

<p>3 of 5) STATE WHAT IS MEANT BY EACH OF THE FOLLOWINGS TERMS APPLIED TO FERTILISERS:<br>
Soluable<br>
Slow release<br>
Straight<br>
Compound<br>
Controlled release</p>
<p>The RHS Website Says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inorganic and organic fertiliser can be found as the following types of products:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Compound fertilisers: These contain a mixture of different nutrients, and may be balanced (containing similar proportions of all the major plant nutrients) or may supply more of some nutrients than others, as per the requirements of different crops. They may be organic or inorganic, or contain both.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Straight fertilisers: These contain only one or mainly one nutrient. They are usually used to provide different nutrients at different times of the year, or to correct particular nutrient deficiencies. They are usually inorganic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Controlled release fertilisers: These are almost always granules of inorganic fertilisers coated with a porous material such as sulphur or synthetic resin. Water enters the granule and the fertilisers leach out into the surrounding soil. The warmer the soil, the faster the leaching; this corresponds to plant growth which is faster in warm weather. By varying the thickness of the coating granules can be designed to feed plants for different periods of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Slow release fertilisers: These degrade slowly, usually under the influence of soil micro-organisms to release their nutrients and again are dependant on soil temperature. These are usually organic and include hoof &amp; horn and bone meal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4 of 5) STATE WHAT IS MEANT BY EACH OF THE FOLLOWINGS TERMS:</p>
<p>Base dressing<br>
Top dressing<br>
Liquid feed<br>
Foliar feed</p>
<p>using ONE NAMED SITUATION TO ILLUSTRATE THE USE OF EACH</p>
<p>RHS WEBSITE SAYS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Top dressing: This is the application of quick-acting fertilisers to the soil surface around plants to stimulate growth, and is usually carried out in spring at the start of the growing season. Take care to avoid leaf contact, which can cause scorching, and to protect against over application, which could cause root damage and pollution of ground water.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Base dressing: This is the incorporation of fertiliser into the soil or potting compost before sowing or planting.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Watering on: Liquid fertilisers or soluble powders and granules can be dissolved or diluted and watered onto plant roots during the growing season to give them an instant boost. They are mainly used for feeding glasshouse crops, pot plants and bedding. The nutrients in liquid fertilisers are instantly available. Care must be taken to avoid leaf contact, which can cause scorching.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Foliar feeding: This is the application of a dilute solution of fertiliser to the leaves of plants, useful as an emergency treatment for correcting nutrient deficiencies or for providing quick supplementary feeding. The absorption of liquid fertiliser is greatest where leaf surfaces are tender, particularly on the under surfaces of leaves or on young leaves that are just expanding. Foliar feeds should not be applied in bright sunlight because the foliage may be scorched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5 of 5) STATE THE  BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF NUTRIENT SOURCES:<br>
Environmental<br>
Health and safety issues<br>
Timing of Application<br>
Variability of the material</p>
